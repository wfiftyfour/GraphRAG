Extract ALL meaningful relationships between entities from the text.

For each relationship, provide:
- source: Source entity name (MUST match exactly from entities list)
- target: Target entity name (MUST match exactly from entities list)
- relationship: Relationship type (choose most specific from list below)
- description: Brief description of how they relate

Text:
{text}

Entities to consider: {entities}

RELATIONSHIP TYPES (use UPPERCASE):

**Health Requirements & Recommendations:**
- RECOMMENDED_FOR: amount/nutrient/screening recommended for demographic
- REQUIRES: demographic requires nutrient/screening/level
- ADVISED_AT: screening/test advised at specific age
- STANDARD_FOR: typical/normal range for demographic

**Biological Effects:**
- AFFECTS: impacts health/body part/function
- CAUSES: directly causes condition/symptom
- PREVENTS: prevents condition/symptom
- INCREASES: increases level/risk/amount
- DECREASES: decreases level/risk/amount
- TRIGGERS: triggers symptom/condition

**Support & Function:**
- SUPPORTS: supports body part/function/goal
- HELPS_BUILD: helps build/maintain body part
- MAINTAINS: maintains health state/body part
- PROTECTS: protects against condition/damage

**Risk & Association:**
- RISK_FACTOR_FOR: increases risk of condition
- ASSOCIATED_WITH: associated with condition/symptom
- INDICATES: symptom indicates condition
- INFLUENCES: factors that influence requirements/levels

**Measurement & Testing:**
- MEASURED_BY: condition/hormone measured by test
- DETECTS: screening detects condition
- MONITORS: test monitors biomarker/condition

**Lifestyle & Behavior:**
- DEPLETES: lifestyle factor depletes nutrient/hormone
- ENHANCES: lifestyle factor enhances outcome/level
- MODIFIES: lifestyle factor modifies requirement/risk

**Demographics & Prevalence:**
- MORE_COMMON_IN: condition more common in demographic
- APPLIES_TO: guideline applies to demographic
- TYPICAL_FOR: characteristic typical for demographic

**Comparison & Context:**
- HIGHER_THAN: level/amount higher than comparison group
- LOWER_THAN: level/amount lower than comparison group
- DIFFERS_FROM: differs from comparison group

GUIDELINES:
- Extract EVERY relationship explicitly stated or strongly implied
- Use most specific relationship type
- Ensure entity names match EXACTLY (case-sensitive)
- Include quantitative relationships (age ranges, thresholds, dosages)
- Capture both positive and negative relationships
- Extract multi-hop relationships (A→B, B→C means A→C if implied)

Return ONLY a valid JSON array:
