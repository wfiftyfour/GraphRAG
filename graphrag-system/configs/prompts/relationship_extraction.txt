Extract relationships between the given entities from the text.

For each relationship, provide:
- source: Source entity name (must match exactly)
- target: Target entity name (must match exactly)
- relationship: Type of relationship (use UPPERCASE, e.g., FOUNDED, WORKS_AT, LOCATED_IN, ACQUIRED, DEVELOPED, PARTNERED_WITH)
- description: Brief description of the relationship

Text:
{text}

Entities to consider: {entities}

Guidelines:
- Only extract relationships that are explicitly stated or strongly implied
- Use consistent relationship types
- Make sure entity names match exactly

Return ONLY a valid JSON array:
[{{"source": "...", "target": "...", "relationship": "...", "description": "..."}}]
